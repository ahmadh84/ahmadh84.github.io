  abstract  = {{Multi-tag bioimaging systems such as the toponome imaging system (TIS) require sophisticated analytical methods to extract molecular signatures of various types of cells. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm for mining cell phenotypes based on their high-dimensional co-expression profiles contained within the images generated by the robotically controlled TIS microscope installed at Warwick. The proposed paradigm employs a refined cell segmentation algorithm followed by a locality preserving nonlinear embedding algorithm which is shown to produce significantly better cell classification and phenotype distribution results as compared to its linear counterpart.}},
